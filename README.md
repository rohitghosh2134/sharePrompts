## Local Development

To run Prompt Galore on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/prompt-galore.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd prompt-galore
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure the following environment variables:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google Client ID for authentication.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google Client Secret for authentication.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A random secret used for NextAuth authentication.
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The URL of your local development environment, e.g., `http://localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>`.
- `NEXTAUTH_INTERNAL_URL`: The internal URL of your local development environment, e.g., `http://localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>`.

To set up the required credentials and generate the necessary secrets, follow the steps below:

1. Obtain Google Client ID and Client Secret:
   - Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing project.
   - Enable the Google Identity API.
   - Go to the "Credentials" section and create credentials for your web application.
   - Note down the generated Client ID and Client Secret.

2. Generate NextAuth Secret:
   - Open a terminal in the project directory.
   - Run the following command to generate a secret:
     ```bash
     npx next-auth show-config | grep secret | awk '{print $2}'
     ```
   - Note down the generated secret.

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Open the file and add the following content:
     ```plaintext
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
     NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
     NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>
     NEXTAUTH_INTERNAL_URL=http://localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>
     ```
   - Replace `your-google-client-id`, `your-google-client-secret`, `your-nextauth-secret`, `<PORT_NUMBER>` with your actual values.

### Running Locally

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>`, where `<PORT_NUMBER>` is the port number specified in your Next.js configuration (usually `3000` by default).

2. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>` to access Prompt Galore.

## Usage

Once you have

 the application running locally, you can use it as follows:

- Sign in using your Google account to access the full functionality of Prompt Galore.
- Browse through the available prompts shared by the community.
- Share your own prompts by clicking the "New Prompt" button and providing the necessary details.
- Search for prompts or filter them based on tags.
- Interact with other users by leaving comments and participating in discussions on individual prompt pages.

## Deployment

Prompt Galore is automatically deployed on Vercel whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. You can also set up your own deployment process according to your needs.

```

Note: Replace `your-google-client-id`, `your-google-client-secret`, `your-nextauth-secret`, and `<PORT_NUMBER>` with the actual values you obtained from the respective services.
